# Final Project for LIS 549
## Family recipe collection
This website will be a collection of family recipes that have otherwise been tethered to index cards, shoved in accordion folders, buried in email inboxes, etc.! I am creating this site to gather these materials in one place, reachable by any family member at any time regardless of their location.
